# CPP-Linked-List

A C++ implementation of a Linked List.

This is my first C++ project.

## Part 1 - C++ Linked List Implementation
### Goals
 ✔ Push items | 
 ✔ Pop items | 
 ✔ Output lists | 
 ✔ Item search | 
 ✔ Item insertion | 
 ❌ Item removal | 
 ❌ Sorting

## Part 2 - Python Library
Create Python library from C++ implementation.

## Part 3 - Python Linked List Implementation
### Goals
 ✔ Push items | 
 ❌ Pop items | 
 ✔ Output lists | 
 ❌ Item search | 
 ❌ Item insertion | 
 ❌ Item removal | 
 ❌ Sorting

## Part 4 - Performance Comparison
Compare performance of Python linked list and C++ linked list.
(Presumably C++ will be faster, but by how much?)
